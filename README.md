# Snake
Countless hours on my old Nokia phone, wasted on this game.

A bit of fun game, if you find any bugs let me know through the GitHub issues.

I've added a feature where the snake speeds up after each time it eats food, but I'm not too sure this was part of the original game, it does make it tricky to control above 70!
